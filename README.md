# BinGo

BinGo is a standalone visual concurrency debugger for Go that makes goroutines, channels, and synchronization behavior easy to understand. It captures detailed runtime events and turns them into clear, interactive visualizations, whether you’re running it as a terminal UI or inside editors like VS Code or Vim. With features like goroutine lifecycle tracking, channel and mutex inspection, timeline replay, and deadlock or leak detection, BinGo helps developers see how their concurrent programs actually behave and debug tricky issues that traditional tools miss. Its modular design keeps the core engine UI-agnostic, so new frontends and integrations can be built easily by the community.
