# Existing Solutions Analysis


## Meeting 1:  January 19th, 2025


- We met with Robert Laganière. He agreed to be our client for this project. He is a professor who teaches programming paradigms at the University of Ottawa.
- He is an expert at Go and has a lot of experience working with idiomatic patterns in go, especially in concurrent programming.
- We pitched our ideas and trajectory for the project. He seems onboard and is excited to work with us. We agreed to have bi-weekly meetings to discuss our progress and get feedback from him.
- We discussed the existing solutions for Go concurrency debugging. Robert mentioned that while there are tools like `go tool trace` and delve, they lack interactivity and a concurrency-focused approach.
- We brainstormed features that would be beneficial for our tool, such as visualizing goroutine interactions, detecting common concurrency bugs, and providing an intuitive UI for developers.
